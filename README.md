# Aniso_MLMD

Machine Learning for learning anisotropic particle energies used in coarse-graining.

The force and torque of anisotropic coarse grained particles are predicted with a neural network model designed to predict many-body interactions.

Note: This repo is still in progress. More guidelines will be posted once the results are finalized.
